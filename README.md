UNFINISHED PROJECT

todo:

- [x] SDF in opacity to enable smooth transition
- [x] UV dilation when capturing
- [x] Multi-pass capturing for postprocessing (sdf and uvdilation), "blit chain"
- [x] Create imposter actor in sublevel
- [x] Use builtin quad mesh instead of runtime generated one
- [ ] Support roughness, metallic and AO map (already has a capture material for RMA)
- [ ] Plugin UI

bugs:

- [x] duplicate naming will cause crash
- [ ] sublevel cannot save
